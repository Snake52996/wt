How should I configure it?",answer:"It configures the expected time needed to transform your password into the key used to protect the database. Larger value likely results in safer data but also longer wait for each time you open your database. You should set it to the largest value you feel acceptable and we will take care of finding parameters to satisfy it. As a special note, the actual time required also depends on hardware capabilities and system load, so you should better probe parameters on the weakest device you plan to access your database, or you may find significantly prolonged wait time when switching to those devices."},probing_time:{question:"Probing is slow, can you fix it?",answer:"There is not a single parameter configuring the time required directly. We have to run the algorithm multiple times (i.e. benchmarking) to find a set of parameters satisfying the time requirement, so generally the answer is no. But nothing to worry about: the algorithm will run only once each time you open your database, not multiple times."},online_security:{question:"You can access my data, right?",answer:"Definitely not. Technical answer to this question is no since though you might be using a version built by us and hosted on a server of our choice, no network requests are made after the application has been loaded to your device other than those to acquire your database from server of your choice, which can be easily verified by monitoring network traffics with the developer tools, so the application has simply no chance to submit your data to anywhere. Economic answer to this question is no since it is easy to find free hosting services to provide static (frontend-only) applications like this one, but it is not the case if we want to receive and store your data. All possible outcomes of making use of your data collected, to be honest, is not likely to be able to cover the total cost of renting a server for collecting them, so there is simply no reason to collect your data. Anyway, all source code is available and you are free to exam them or build and host your own instance if you would like."},access_by_third_party:{question:"Can the password verification bypassed, say, by modifying the code?",answer:"No. When opening your database, the application is not just handling data which is always ready in the database to anyone with a correct password, but recovering real data from the database with the password supplied. This difference seems minor, but is indeed significant: the data does not exist, not in an accessible way, before a correct password is used to transform it. Anyone can open the main database file directly without this application since it is nothing special than a commonly used JSON file, but there are only random bytes if they do not decrypt it with the correct password."},implement_detail:{question:"I want to know details about how my database is protected.",answer:"All data in your database, together with the database configurations, are encrypted with AES in GCM mode with 256-bit key, referred as the data key, generated randomly when the database is created. Images are also encrypted by the data key but as separate files instead of embedded into the main data file to reduce file sizes, and the header of the images are preserved to make them looks like images. This leaks no content of the images but only the image size of PNG images. The data key is, in turn, encrypted by a key derived from the password you set using Argon2, which is referred as the user key. The user key, together with the password, is never saved but dropped once the data key is encrypted (when creating databases) or decrypted (when opening databases). This dual key structure is widely used and allows changing password without re-encrypting the whole database. Someone without a correct password, user key or data key can only acquire the following meaningful information from the database: the number of items in it if you configured the database to include an image for each item and the parameters used when invoking Argon2."}},welcome:"Welcome to work-tracker",welcome_detail:"This guide will help you build a database to track works you like (and you don't like)",summary_and_done:"Done!",security_setup:"Security setup",security_setup_detail:"Decide how your data will be protected",kdf_target_time:"Target login time",kdf_target_time_hint:"Maximum time you would like to wait when system is verifying your password",kdf_detail_control:"I am an expert, let me configure this!",kdf_memory:"Memory (m in argon2 parameters)",kdf_iteration_hint:"specifying this value will disable probing",kdf_iteration:"Number of iterations (t in argon2 parameters)",kdf_threads:"Number of threads to use (p in argon2 parameters)",validate_argon2_parameters:"validate parameters",probe_argon2_parameters:"probe parameters",password:"password to protect the database",salt:"random data to ensure your password is unique",key:"fingerprint of generated key",generate_a_key:"generate a key",general_configuration:"General configuration",datasource_name:"name of the database",entry_setting:"Entry setting",entry_setting_detail:"Decide what should be displayed for each item",load_existing_configuration:{label:"Load from existing configuration",hint:"This will replace anything you have configured below!"},include_image:"Include a cover image",width:"width",pixel:"pixel",height:"height",add_new_entry:"Add new entry",entry_name:"name of the entry",entry_sorting_method:"Is this entry sortable?",entry_type:"data type of the entry",entry_types:{string:{name:"string",description:"write anything you want"},tag:{name:"tag",description:"short strings, newly created or picked from created ones"},rating:{name:"rating",description:"rating points with optional justifying comments"}},optional:"make this optional",optional_detail:"If this entry can be omitted",summary_and_done_detail:"The database has been created!
